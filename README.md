# My Phase-1 Final Project

# Project Description: 

My project is a website that contacts an API to retrieve NBA player team stats, then displays all of the players received from the API. The primary purpose of the website is to search by team and display all of the available players from that team.  Additionally, there is an option to search by player last name (in addition to team name) if they only want to display info about a specific player.  Once the user has displayed players of interest, they can click on the name of a player they are interested in to initiate a Google search for that player (with the keyword "basketball" at the end to ensure relevant results). As the user selects players and teams, the displayed player list will continue to grow to allow the user to compare players from different teams. If the user wishes to clear the displayed players and start over, they can use the "clear" button.

# Usage Instructions:

Users will use a dropdown menu to select the team they are interested in. If the user sees a player of interest in the table and wants to pull up that player only, they can double-click on the player's last name to auto-populate it in the "last name" input field so they don't have to memorize the spelling. Pressing "clear" will remove all displayed player info so the user can start a new list.

# Future Plans for Updates:

In the future I plan to add additional functionality to the website to improve ease-of-use for the user. For example, I would like to expand the search functionality so the user can search by last name only (without selecting a team). I would also like to add an additional input field on the form to allow users to search by conference or division.
