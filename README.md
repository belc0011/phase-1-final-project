# My Phase-1 Final Project

# Project Description: 

My project is a website that contacts the "ballsdontlie" Open API to retrieve NBA players' relevant team stats, then displays all of the players received from the API. The primary purpose of the website is to find older/more obscure players that have played on different NBA teams, and then find out more information about those players. You can search by team and display all of the available players from that team, or there is an option to search by player last name (in addition to team name) if the user only wants to display info about a specific player they see. Once a player is displayed, users can click on the name to get additional information about the player. As the user selects players and teams, the displayed player list will continue to grow to allow the user to compare players from different teams. If the user wishes to clear the displayed players and start over, they can use the "clear" button.

# Usage Instructions:

Users will use a dropdown menu to select the team they are interested in. If the user sees a player of interest in the table and wants to pull up that player only, they can double-click on the player's last name to auto-populate it in the "last name" input field so they don't have to memorize the spelling. Hovering over last names in the table will display a message to the user informing them of this feature. Pressing "clear" will remove all displayed player info so the user can start a new list. Clicking on the name of a displayed player will initiate a Google search for that player (with the keyword "basketball" at the end to ensure relevant results). The "clear" button initiates a page refresh, which will restore the website to its original state (removing a long list of displayed players if the user wants to start over).

# Future Plans for Updates:

In the future I plan to add additional functionality to the website to improve ease-of-use for the user. For example, I would like to expand the search functionality so the user can search by last name only (without selecting a team). I would also like to add an additional input field on the form to allow users to search by conference or division. Finally, I would like to ensure that when searching by team, the displayed players' names are listed in alphabetical order.
